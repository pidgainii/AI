# 🧪 Gaussian Data Generator - Task 1

This Python desktop application allows you to generate and visualize 2D data samples drawn from Gaussian (normal) distributions, organized by classes and modes.

## 📌 Description

The program generates synthetic data simulating two distinct classes, each with multiple modes (distribution centers). Points are generated using a normal distribution with random means and variances for each mode. The results are dynamically displayed on an integrated plot using Matplotlib and PyQt5.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **PyQt5** – for the graphical user interface
- **Matplotlib** – for data visualization
- **NumPy** – for random data generation

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Modes per class**: Set how many modes each class will have (e.g., 2).
2. **Samples per mode**: Set how many data points to generate per mode.
3. Click **"Generate Data"** to create and visualize the samples.

Blue points represent Class 0, and red points represent Class 1.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install PyQt5 matplotlib numpy
